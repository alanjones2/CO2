# CO2 data

Four data files:
    
- main file:
  - global-co2-fossil-plus-land-use.csv a copy from Our [World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-data-update-2022) (OWID)
- Derived files are subsets created from the main OWID file
  - continents_df.csv
  - countries_df.csv
  - income_types_df.csv

Two notebooks:
  - make_dfs.ipynb - create the subset files
  - show_dfs.csv - display the files
